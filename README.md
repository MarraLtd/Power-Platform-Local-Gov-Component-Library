# Power Platform Local Government Component Library

The Local Government Component Library is an organized collection of reusable components for front-end development of Canvas Apps in the domain of Local Government. These components play a crucial role in enhancing development cohesion and UI consistency whilst being customisable to authority-specific styling and responsive to differing page designs. 

The library's components are compliant with Government Design System (GDS) and meet the [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) Accessibility Guidelines.

# Solution Contents

##  LocalGov Components

The components themselves are contained in the **Master - LocalGov Components** library. To use the components in your own Canvas App, follow these steps:

1. Open a canvas app in the environment you downloaded and imported the solution in.

2. Go to Insert > Get more components (file and magnifying glass symbol) > Master - LocalGov Components > Select all components needed > Import.

3. Components can be used in a Canvas App as Library Components from the **Insert** menu.

## Example App

The example app contains a typical application which has all the components on 2 separate user journeys. This can be used as guidance when creating custom functionality and theming for your own applications.
